            <body> Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal disease affecting the motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord.  Motor neurons are responsible for controling body movements including such movements as walking, talking, eating, and breathing. Progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to neural necrosis. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is permanently lost.

                Currently, there is NO CURE FOR ALS.
                
                This project sought to predict the length of survival of ALS subjects. Death from onset of disease is rapid but also heterogeneous, with 50% dying within three years of symptom onset, 75% within the first five years, and 90% within 10 years. 
                
                
                Data was provided by the PRO-ACT ALS organization. The dataset contained data on over 10,000 clinical trial participants, and included ... However, few values were available across multiple domains for each subject.
                
                ALS is a terminal, progressive disease. Most ALS subjects die as a result of resperatory failure. Disease progression is measured using validated functional assessments including the ALSFRS, Forced Vital Capacity. 
                
                
                
                This project used data collected from over 25 ALS clinical trials.
