# Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - aka ALS, Lou Gehrigâ€™s Disease, Motor Neuron Disease   

Predict length of survival in ALS subjects.

## Project Overview  

### ALS

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as motor neurone disease (MND) or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a fatal disease affecting the motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord.  Motor neurons are responsible for controling body movements including such movements as walking, talking, eating, and breathing. Progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to neural necrosis. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is permanently lost.  

Currently, there is NO CURE FOR ALS.
                
This project sought to predict the length of survival of ALS subjects. Death from onset of disease is rapid but also heterogeneous, with 50% dying within three years of symptom onset, 75% within the first five years, and 90% within 10 years. 

Data was provided by the PRO-ACT ALS organization. The dataset contained data on over 10,000 clinical trial participants, and included ... However, few values were available across multiple domains for each subject.  
                
ALS is a terminal, progressive disease. Most ALS subjects die as a result of resperatory failure. Disease progression is measured using validated functional assessments including the ALSFRS, Forced Vital Capacity.  

This project used data collected from over 25 ALS clinical trials. 
Each year approximately 5,600 American's are diagnosed with ALS.  

### Data

Data for this project was provided by 9500 subjects in  dataset
25 clinical trials
- all trials to date have failed!

~ 1/3 of subjects in dataset are placebo, others received intervention. Will use placebo subset for analysis.

### The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS)

Overview:
The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS) is an instrument for evaluating the functional status of patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. It can be used to monitor functional change in a patient over time.

Measures:
- speech
- salivation
- swallowing
- handwriting
- cutting food and handling utensils (with or without gastrostomy)
- dressing and hygiene
- turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes
- walking
- climbing stairs
- respiratory
